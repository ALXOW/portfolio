            <p class="About">

                I’m Alxow, also known as ALI, a Syrian musical artist currently based in France. My music is deeply experimental, blending various genres with ambient sounds to create a one-of-a-kind auditory experience. My work thrives on pushing boundaries and crafting sonic landscapes that are both immersive and innovative.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into music began in 2019 when I wanted to create music for my own songs. What started as a simple desire to bring my lyrics to life quickly grew into a full-scale project. I took on every aspect of the music-making process, from songwriting and singing to composing and producing. Over time, I developed a distinct style that blends different musical influences into something entirely my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I’m the creative force behind two projects that fall under my independent label, <strong>El 3abath</strong>. Under this label, I work on both <strong>ALXOW</strong> and <strong>El 3abath</strong>, each of which allows me to express different sides of my musical identity. Whether I’m experimenting with electronic elements, atmospheric soundscapes, or fusing multiple genres, my goal is to create music that resonates emotionally and breaks the mold of traditional genres.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music is more than just sound for me; it's a means of expression, a way to connect, and a space to explore creative freedom. My hope is that through my music, listeners are able to find their own emotional connection and embark on their own sonic journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for being a part of this journey. Stay tuned for more experimental projects and music releases under <strong>El 3abath</strong>.
